# Prereading

- This isn't a guide, this is a mechanic explanation. There's many ways to handle these mechanics - do whatever's best for your raid team.
- Light for final encounter is {{power}}.
- Taken Spec is enabled, but all bosses that are vulnerable to gunfire are Hive. Probably just run your normal gun spec unless you're doing things where you only deal with Taken enemies.

## Ammo Generation
This section is for you, Aeon users.
- E1, E2 and E3 have miniboss Knights or Wizards that can be finished for heavy drops. E4 and E5 have none on Legend.
- Hive and Taken are in this raid, so any of the three Champion types could be present on Master in addition to the Unstoppable one already present in E1. Expect Overload Hobgoblins in E4M/E5M.

# Hall of Souls {#outside}

**Do not proceed through the portal if you want the hidden boss chest.**

## Objective
Activate all six statues.

## Mechanics
**Statues**
: Six statues are in the center of the map - activating each of them will spawn a portal and end the encounter. Only statues marked by "dark energy" (Taken ball) can be activated. To activate a statue, it must be deposited at twice in quick succession. Successful rapid dunks will open up the next statue. The text log "A statue hums with dark energy" appears when the eligible statue to dunk at has changed.

### Interactables
**Relics**
: Relics are used to deposit at statues and spawn in sets of two. Relic holders gain the normal relic melee and lose all other class functionality, including jump abilities. Each set lasts for a certain amount of time when any in the set are obtained, depending on set. When a relic is picked up from its starting position, all barriers that would inhibit backwards travel spawn. The first set of relics are near the statues in the middle of the map and get progressively further away from the center, scaling with how many statues are activated. When they are dunked at a statue, they will spawn again after the current statue resolves.

**Barriers**
: The Taken barriers that are triggered by relics spawn in doorways depending on which position that the relic has been acquired. They are immune to damage from relics and their cores are vulnerable to gunfire. Barriers are impassible to players.

### Statuses
**Time Remaining**
: Self-explanatory. Time allotted seems to depend on which set is obtained, but might be passively rolling from 60 seconds and is only shown when both players pick up a relic. Shown to all players when both Relics are obtained. Deposit all relics at the active statue before it runs out or all relics respawn. Resets to 4 seconds when one is deposited.

| Set Number | Duration (s) |
|------------|--------------|
|      1     |      50      |
|      2     |      65      |
|      3     |      30      |
|      4     |      45      |
|      5     |      45?     |
|      6     |      35?     |

## Rewards
One of the following, at world drop light:
- Class Item
- chips got a scout idk
- to be filled in

# Offering (Bonus Boss Chest) {#offering}

Below the platform that the portal is on, there are three runes displayed out of a pool of 9. Scattered throughout the raid are green flaming plates, each of them having a specific rune when it's activated. Activating them **and only them** grants an additional drop from final boss that has a raid weapon with **guaranteed** Deepsight Resonance. Shooting an activated rune will deactivate it and vice-versa. Once all 3 have been activated, a text string will appear with "The runes accept your offering".
- The lockout is weekly, once per account.
- To be explicit, it must be done in one complete run.
- You cannot backtrack without OoBing - the doors close behind you in every encounter. If it is anything like Vow of the Disciple, OoBing may cause softlocks.

### Locations
There are 9 runes in the raid. Ishtar Collective has no data on the names aside from the Typing rune, so have fun communicating this to your raid. I included the nicknames that my group decided on, but feel free to use your own.

# Basketball Court / Touch of Malice Catalyst {#catalyst}

If anyone in the raid has Touch of Malice, the Basketball Court is accessible and contains the ToM catalyst. To play some B-ball, all three hidden statues in the raid must be activated. To activate them, their respective dormant plate must be activated and the minigame of bringing relics to a statue must be done. There are three dormant plates scattered around the raid. Once a user with Touch of Malice (equipped?) activates one of said plates, the "statue hums" line appears and multiple relics appear around the area that must be dunked at the nearby statue within a handful of seconds of each other. Failure to do so quickly will presumably respawn the relics.

The plates are in the following three locations and all must be completed to open the door.
- Behind the Court of Oryx, in the back left building in the distance. The statue is located behind the portal.
- In Golgoroth's Maze, second hidden chest location. Statue is in a pit before exiting the maze.
- In Transept, third hidden chest location

Inside, there is a final fourth plate. Finishing the final set of dunks inside the court will grant the catalyst to each member in the raid who has Touch of Malice in collections.

---

# Portico {#platforming}

Cross the expanse by jumping on tombships.

Jump on the first tombship to activate it. Make the following jumps in order:
- Jump on the tombship visible on the direct right, it will start to pass underneath the first ship
- Jump on the tombship visible to the right as it intersects the second ship
- Jump on the tombship visible to the left as it intersects the third ship
- Jump to the platform attached to the upcoming left side pillar

This is an optional player respawn point. Make the next jumps in order:
- Jump on the tombship underneath the platform when it approaches
- Jump on the tombship that spawns on the left as it intersects
- Jump **over** the tombship that blocks the way of the one that is active (you can also just move around it)
- Jump on the tombship that spawns on the right
- Jump on the tombship that spawns on the right
- Jump on the tombship that spawns on the left
- Jump on the tombship that spawns to the north
- Jump to solid ground

There are two sets of buttons here, one before the tombship and one afterwards. Any set being activated will deactivate the barrier that allows players on the ship to cross without being pushed into a death plane.

## Hidden Chest

On the left side of the wall on the final tombship, there is a hidden chest. The door is only open while the barrier is deactivated, but can be bypassed by using Stasis Crystals to climb the wall instead. Chest contents unknown (and obviously the same light as legendary drops), but seems to always give a KF raid mod that hasn't been obtained when not on lockout.

# Basilica: Door ![Unstoppable Champions]({{"assets/images/destiny/champion_icons/Unstoppable_Champion_icon.png" | relative_url}}){:height="20px" width="20px"} {#totems}

Encounter starts by picking up any Brand. The room is split into two, with one Annihilator Totem on each side. Taken enemies path to the left room, Hive enemies try to path to the right. Sword Knights will path to nearby allies instead. Unstoppable Ogres and the Hive that are alive at the start and will path to the middle plate. Wizards and the Blightguard stay on their platforms.

## Objective
The objective of the encounter is to open the door by depositing roughly 200 stacks at its entrance.

### TL;DR
- Get Brands
- Sit on plates
- Kill Wizards and Blightguards on sight
- Only Brand users kill trash
- Brand Claimers take the Brands before they blow up
- Deposit stacks at door

## Mechanics
**Annihilator Totems**

: Same thing as in *Pit of Heresy*. If any of the two totems fully charge, the raid wipes. Can be prevented by standing on the plates beneath them. The rooms that they are in are engulfed in damage auras.

**Blight of Weaving / Unraveling**

: Deals low damage over time. After taking damage for around five seconds from it, instantly kills the target.

### Statuses
**Brand of the Unraveler / Weaver**

: Lasts 30 seconds. Found on the pedestals near the entrance of the totem rooms - Unraveler on the left side and Weaver on the right. Creates a safe zone around the player that negates the fog, granting their respective Aura buff while inside. Once the buff times out, the player who has it dies.

: Killing a minor Hive enemy with Brand of the Unraveler grants a stack of Deathsinger's Power and a major Hive gives 3 stacks. With the Weaver brand, you gain a stack from killing a minor Taken enemy instead and 3 stacks from a major Taken.

**Aura of the Unraveler / Weaver**

: Allows players to pass through the fog without penalty.

**Brand Claimer**

: Lasts 30 seconds. Allows passing of any brand by interacting on the aura while holding the buff and resets the brand's timer.

**Deathsinger's Power**

: Offers no benefit on its own. Can be deposited at a rate of two at a time while standing the door plate. Supposedly negates any aura effects while active. Prevents interacting with Brand Claimer while any stacks are active.

**Annihilator Totem**

: Kills the afflicted player. Inflicted on all players when an Annihilator Totem is charged.

### Interactables
**Pedestals**

: Holds their side's Brand buff on the right side. Only active if their respective Brand is lost.

**Annihilator Plates**

: Prevents the Annihilator Totem above the plate from charging and slowly reverts their charge. Charges in roughly 5 seconds.

**Brand Claimer**

: Grants the user the status of the same name.

**Door Plate**

: Opens the door when enough stacks of Deathsinger's Power have been deposited, around 200. Presumably, each 65 or so will spawn an ![Unstoppable Champion]({{"assets/images/destiny/champion_icons/Unstoppable_Champion_icon.png" | relative_url}}){:height="12px" width="12px"} Ogre.

### Mechanically Relevant Enemies
**Wizard**

: A minor Wizard will spawn out of each door on the side. Killing any side's Wizard will spawn their side's Blightguard.

**Blightguard**

: Blightguards are miniboss Taken Knights. Killing them drops a Brand Claimer.

### Special Enemies
**Adepts**

: Major Acolytes. On death, buffs all nearby Acolytes, augmenting their ranged attack to a Ogre's eye laser beam attack. Only present at the door.

## Challenge: The Grass is Always Greener

No player may hold the same Brand type twice in succession.

## Rewards
One of the following:
- Doom of Chelchis
- Class Item
- Chest
- Legs

# Basilica: Interior {#warpriest}

Encounter starts by activating all three plates at the same time. Add spawns change depending on boss's health.
- Before first damage phase: Rank and file Hive, Revenant Knights and (ultra) Blistered Wizards. All enemies spawn through the arena doors.
- Above ~50% HP: Same as above but with Cursed Thralls and Adepts.
- Below ~50% HP: All adds replaced with Taken; including Hobgoblins, Minotaurs and (ultra) Servile Knights. All enemies spawn through ordinary Taken spawns (aka there are more spawns and at different locations).

## Objective
The objective of the encounter is to kill the Warpriest.

### TL;DR
- Kill all adds
- Touch middle plate
- Touch plates in order of successive callouts
- Get Brand
- DPS while killing the Blightguards to preserve mechanic eligibility
- Brand Claimer dance to save Brand user and extend damage phase, twice
- Hide from wipe mechanic

## Mechanics

**Monoliths**

: The big rock in front of each plate. Can glow on its back, either telegraphing which plate is the first for the glyph sequence or which code is next for in the sequence.

: During the Oculus mechanic, any monoliths that were used to hide to dodge Oculus will be purged from the arena. For subsequent glyph sequences, a glowing red pillar will appear in their place if that monolith would have been glowing.

**Glyph Sequences**

: There are two types of sequences, reading sequence and normal sequence. Reading sequence always starts first.

: During the glyph **reading** sequence, the middle plate will glow green. Any player standing on the middle plate is shown which side is first for the glyph sequence, shown by its back glowing. If left or right are not glowing and the middle monolith is present, middle starts.

: During the glyph sequences, a player must stand on the correct plate to reveal which next plate needs to be stood on. Doing all three plates sequentially will start damage phase.

: If a sequence is done out of order (or presumably if too much time elapses), a text line is printed in chat that the glyphs are released and places a fire entity on all plates and turns them red, dealing damage for every couple of ticks that players are touching them. When all players are off the plates, the glyphs become unreleased. If the glyphs are released for too long, the raid gets architected.

### Statuses

**Brand Claimer**

: Lasts 30 seconds. Allows passing of any brand by interacting on a brand's aura while holding the buff and resets the brand's timer. Decreases the amount of stacks on Brand of the Initiate by 1.

**Brand of the Initiate**

: Lasts 10 seconds. Has 3 stacks. Obtained by being the player to resolve the final plate. Continously grants the Aura of the Initiate buff to all nearby allies. Once the buff resolves from time **if multiple stacks are present**, the player who had it dies. When the buff expires, damage phase ends with the text prompt, "The Warpriest calls upon the Oculus". Also has the effect of Aura of the Initiate.

**Aura of the Initiate**

: Allows players to damage the Warpriest.

**Searing Torrent**

: Flavor status. Shows up when the Oculus is attacking and vanishes afterwards.

### Interactables
**Plates**

: Used in all glyph sequences. Player who activates the final plate gains the Brand of the Initiate buff. Any time Glyphs are released (indicated in kill log) by stepping on any plates that are not part of a sequence, medium reocurring damage will be inflicted to all players on any plate until all players are off of the plates. This is also indicated by the plates glowing red and searing fire. 

### Mechanically Relevant Enemies
**Warpriest**

: Large Knight boss with four extra attacks: Taken Fire from Taken Knights, Retaliation Swarm from Taken Hobgoblins, Darkness Bolt from Taken Captains (only used after Searing Torrent) and Axion Darts from Taken Centurions. Immune to damage from anyone who does not have an Initiate buff. Summons an Oculus after each damage phase.

**Oculus**

: Flavor enemy in the shape of a large Taken ball that hangs out in the back of the arena. Presumably uninteractable. Casts Searing Torrent during damage phase end, dealing [rapid and near-lethal](https://clips.twitch.tv/SpineyInquisitiveWallabyRickroll-c1W-gfASThSwwC_2) damage to any player not hiding behind a monolith. Removes any monoliths that have a player near it after the attack animation ends.

**Revenant Knight**

: Major Hive Knight that spawns when trash mobs are dead and the Warpriest is spawning Hive. Same as normal Knights, but has an Arc shockwave after his overhead slash. Spawns in sets of three, one on each sector of the map with a plate. Killing them starts the glyph reading sequence.

**Ravenous Taken Knight**

: Major Taken Knight that spawns when trash mobs are dead and the Warpriest is spawning Taken. Spawns in sets of three, one on each plate. Killing them starts the glyph reading sequence.

**Blightguard**

: Blightguards are miniboss Taken Knights, only present during damage phase. Killing them drops a Brand Claimer. Unconfirmed what order they spawn in, but they will always:
- Spawn once when a Brand is obtained or passed, up to twice per damage phase
- Spawn near plates
- Never spawn in the same spot twice (in a row?) per damage phase
- Never spawn near the plate that gave the Brand of the Initiate

### Special Enemies
**Adepts**

: Major Acolytes. On death, buffs all nearby Acolytes, augmenting their ranged attack to a Ogre's eye laser beam attack. Only present after first damage phase and if the Warpriest is spawning Hive.

## Challenge: Devious Thievery

Brand Claimers must be used within 5 seconds of being obtained. Additionally, no one can die from the effect of Brand of the Initiate.

: A Dawnblade and dedicated first Brand Claimer point of view for Warpriest Contest Challenge Mode can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQgCsD6VMtM).

## Rewards
One of the following:
- Smite of Merain
- Defiance of Merain
- Arms
- Chest

# Golgoroth's Maze {#maze}

Same layout as D1's labyrinth but has extra stuff in it now. Map [here](https://i.imgur.com/atlBKa4.png).

The path to the exit is:
- Go right
- Go left
- Go left
- Go right, straight until exit

## Hidden Chest
The hidden chest in the area requires all five hidden plates to be held down simultaneously in the maze, in order. First is bottom right, second is top left, third is bottom left, fourth is middle left (jump over the door), fifth is top right. The chest spawns in the middle of the maze.

---

# Golgoroth's Cellar {#golgoroth}

Encounter is started by breaking the poison sac. Add spawns change depending on Golgoroth's health, with Taken adds replacing most Hive ones at lower health values. There is always a single miniboss Wizard spawn at the back of the room before damage phase.

## Objective
Kill Golgoroth.

### TL;DR
- Kill adds
- Get and juggle Gaze, point towards team
- Shoot and kill sac ASAP to optimize time spent doing damage
- Upload Cursed Thrall PoV to YouTube after detonating Unstable Light on ~~teammates~~ Golgoroth
- Break Golgoroth LoS when damage phase ends

## Mechanics
**Tablet of Ruin**

: The tablet is a black stone slab in the back of the room. It accumulates when Golgoroth's Gaze is lost and adds stacks depending on how many potential poison sacs weren't spawned per damage phase. It also accumulates by 2 if Golgoroth's Gaze is not obtained within roughly 10 seconds after a poison sac appears. If six runes are present, Exodia is summoned and instantly knocks your raid's life points to zero.

### Statuses
**Golgoroth's Gaze**

: Caretaker will inflict a debuff of the same name on someone who shoots him in the back with the text prompt, "Golgoroth shifts his Gaze to ``<PLAYERNAME>``". While Gaze is active, Golgoroth will fire swarms of Golgoroth's Rage at the debuffed player instead of using the normal Ogre attack kit. Lasts 20 seconds, only one gaze can be active at a time. Breaking line of sight or gaining any form of invisibility instantly removes the debuff. Gaining Gaze while it is active will purge it on any other players. If gained while any other Gazes are active, a wave of adds will spawn near the door in the back of the pit (unsure if on a timer or if this is the spawn condition).

**Pool of Reclaimed Light**

: Continously granted to those standing in a pool of Reclaimed Light that is dropped from a poison sac. The pool lasts roughly 15 seconds. Allows players inside to ignore Golgoroth's damage resistance on his stomach.

**Unstable Light**

: Lasts 7 seconds. Seems to be periodically afflicted on any player who has Pool of Reclaimed Light. One player does their best Grandmaster Cursed Thrall impression, dealing lethal damage to any nearby allies and dealing ~250k damage to Golgoroth if nearby, presumably ignoring damage resistance. Creates a humming noise that can be heard by all players and gets louder the closer it is to resolving.

**Drained of Light**

: Progressively reduces the player's visibility, similar to all the other screen wipe debuffs. Kills the victim after 7 seconds. Inflicted to all allies when Golgoroth enrages or when the Tablet of Ruin is complete.

**Ogre's Venom**

: Lasts around 1 second. Does nothing? Obtained when taking damage from Golgoroth's Rage.

### Interactables
**Poison Sac**

: Appears when Golgoroth's Gaze has been obtained / passed, aside from the cosmetic one that starts the encounter. Has 6 spawn spots on the ceiling, in a zig-zag pattern, starting left-most nearest the entrance and ends right-most furthest from the entrance. The When Golgoroth's Gaze is broken, no more poison sacs in sequence will spawn. When the first poison sac is broken 4 times, Golgoroth enrages.

### Mechanically Relevant Enemies
**Golgoroth**

: Immune to damage everywhere but his exposed back. His back becomes exposed after killing all the enemies in the room and will become rearmored if no one has Gaze after obtaining it once ("lost Gaze / failed to capture" prompt), not breaking his back within 15 seconds of it appearing (latter prompt as the last one) or Gaze being removed 6 times (Golgoroth becomes tired).

: Breaking his back will grant Golgoroth's Gaze, changing Golg's kit from the standard Ogre kit to an Axion Dart spammer and lock both his aggro and facing to the player with Gaze. Golgoroth's Axion Darts have a special name (Golgoroth's Rage) and inflict Ogre's Venom in addition to normal Axion Dart effects.

: When a player has Gaze, Golgoroth's stomach will glow white and can be damaged, but with ~95% damage resistance. Standing in a pool of Reclaimed Light will allow outgoing damage to ignore Golgoroth's damage resistance. Weak spot is his glowing core on his stomach. Enrages after breaking the first poison sac 4 times.

### Special Enemies
**Adepts**

: Major Acolytes. On death, buffs all nearby Acolytes, augmenting their ranged attack to a Ogre's eye laser beam attack.

## Challenge: Gaze Amaze

Any time Golgoroth's Gaze is removed, it must be accompanied by the Pool of Reclaimed Light buff.

: A Behemoth point of view for Golgoroth Contest Challenge Mode can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MUnKoyJVEI).

- Zaouli's Bane
- Midha's Reckoning
- Helmet

# Transept {#dickwall}

Traverse the walls to the next encounter. Don't get knocked off. Standing on a plate will activate platforms to the next plate. Once all 3 plates are held down, they become pressed without players standing on them. 

## Hidden Chest
There is a set of secret platforms that are activated by pulling out a Ghost, starting at the first plate and ending at a jump before the final hidden chest.

---

# Daughters of Oryx {#daughters}

Presumably, there is an enrage here, but I have never seen it because the sisters probably lost an extra 0 for their health bars. Welcome to the new accessible spoils farm.

## Objective
Kill the Deathsingers.

### TL;DR
- Become Emrakul, the Aeons Torn
- Use Flying to get over enemy blockers and get the Brand Claimer
- Declare attack on non-red Plainswalker
- Force enemy player to sacrifice target permanent
- Get banned in Commander
- This is staying in the release version

## Mechanics

### Statuses

**Brand Claimer**

: Lasts 30 seconds. Allows passing of any brand by interacting on the aura while holding the buff.

**Dirge of Unraveling / Hymn of Weaving**

: Lasts 120 seconds. When it times out, inflicts instant death. Inflicted on all players when a phase starts and ends the phase when the debuff effect fully resolves.

**Brand of Weaving / Unraveling**

: Grants the Aura effect of the same type to all nearby allies who are standing in the sphere of influence. Also grants the effects of said Aura. Removed upon death or on phase transition.

**Aura of Weaving / Unraveling**

: Immune to all sources of damage that aren't instant death and debuffs of the same named type.

**Torn Between Dimensions**

: Inflicted on a random player that is not touching a plate (might be set to a lower priority?) when a player stands on the correct first plate, if no other players are Torn Between Dimensions. Allows them to stand on translucent platforms. Draws aggro on all boss enemies. Suppresses all abilities besides jump abilities and inflicts a disarm. Turns their screen monochrome and changes the afflicted player's color scheme and texture to look more like the Taken. Reinflicted on another eligible player upon death.

### Interactables

**Piece of the Blightguard**

: Looks like Toland. Spawns on a translucent platform above the arena. Replaced with a Brand Claimer when two have been collected.

**Brand Claimer**

: Spawns on a translucent platform above the arena when two pieces of the Blightguard have been obtained. Grants a status effect of the same name.

**Plates**

: There are four plates in the room. The first green plate will have a Revenant Knight spawn on it. Any plates being activated will Tear an ally, if there isn't a Torn player already. Anyone on an activated plate can see the location of the Blightguard / Brand Claimer while they are on it. The second eligible plate is the plate under the floating objective. If both plates are activated in order, platforms will appear that the Torn player can jump on while the plates remain activated. Two(?) platforms will also spawn around the arena depending on plates activated, holding a Taken ranged unit on each of them. If any plate is activated out of order, rapid damage will be continously dealt to all players on plates until no players are standing on plates.

### Mechanically Relevant Enemies

**Ir Halak, Deathsinger**

: Hive Wizard boss. Starts each phase with Brand of Weaving. Supposedly treated as a vehicle for the purposes of Wardcliff Coil (e.g. enjoy this while you can). While singing, doesn't attack and inflicts Dirge of Unraveling on the raid. Only one Deathsinger can be singing at a time (do they always alternate? is the first one static?).

**Ir Anûk, Deathsinger**

: Same as above, but replace Weaving with Unraveling and vice-versa.

## Challenge: Under Construction

No player can activate a plate more than once per phase.

: A Sentinel point of view for Daughters Contest Challenge Mode can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5gxkLiunNo).

## Mechanics

### Interactables

**Piece of the Blightguard**

: Looks like Toland. Spawns on a translucent platform above the arena. Replaced with a Brand Claimer when two have been collected.

**Brand Claimer**

: Spawns on a translucent platform above the arena when two pieces of the Blightguard have been obtained. Grants a status effect of the same name.

**Plates**

: There are four plates in the room. The first green plate per set of six will have Oryx slam it. Any subsequent first plates in set of two will be highlighted in green. Any plates being activated will Tear an ally, if there isn't a Torn player already. Anyone on an activated plate can see the location of the Blightguard / Brand Claimer while they are on it. The second eligible plate is the plate under the floating objective. If both plates are activated in order, platforms will appear that the Torn player can jump on while the plates remain activated. Two(?) platforms will also spawn around the arena depending on plates activated, holding a Taken ranged unit on each of them. If any plate is activated out of order, rapid damage will be continously dealt to all players on plates until no players are standing on plates.

**Corrupted Light**

: Looks similar to a Taken Blight. When activated, prints a text log and then roughly three seconds afterwards, kills all Guardians not under the effect of an Immortality buff. If detonated while Oryx is channeling Doxology, he becomes vulnerable for five seconds per bomb resolved during the channel. Can be eaten by any Hive Knight, empowering them and removing it from the field. Despawns upon entering final stand.

**Dome**

: The thunderdome / Darkness Sphere / "this has no name given to the player" is active while the Shade of Oryx is alive. This always appears in front of Oryx at the end of a phase, should he choose to use it. If any Taken Thrall touch it, they teleport inside the dome. Supposedly, touching the outside of the dome is instant death. All players inside are teleported out when the Shade dies. Players are periodically teleported inside while the dome is active.

### Statuses

**Brand Claimer**

: Lasts 30 seconds. Allows passing of any brand by interacting on the aura while holding the buff and resets the brand's timer.

**Torn Between Dimensions**

: Inflicted on a random player that is not touching a plate (might be set to a lower priority?) when a player stands on the correct first plate, if no other players are Torn Between Dimensions. Allows them to stand on translucent platforms. Draws aggro on all boss enemies. Suppresses all abilities besides jump abilities and inflicts a disarm. Turns their screen monochrome and changes the afflicted player's color scheme and texture to look more like the Taken. Reinflicted on another eligible player upon death.

**Brand of Immortality**

: Continously grants the Aura of Immortality buff to all nearby allies and grants the effect of Aura of Immortality to self. Lost upon dying or phase transition. Obtained from using the Brand Claimer on the Vessel of Oryx.

**Aura of Immortality**

: Immune to all sources of damage that aren't instant death.

**Channeling Corrupted Light**

: What it says on the tin. Starts detonating all Corrupted Lights that the player is standing in after roughly 2 seconds of activation. Activation is printed in the kill feed.

**Darkness Dimension**

: Debuff from being inside the dome. Prevents natural health regeneration. When all raid members have this, the raid wipes. Removed upon leaving the dome.

### Mechanically Relevant Enemies
**Oryx, The Taken King**

: Attacks by using Fist of Darkness (the instakill slam), Spite of the King (the spit) and Doxology (the raid wipe, always has the Darkness text tell). Has two special attacks at the end of a phase and will only use one of them: Summon Darkness Sphere (Shade of Oryx minigame) or Wrath of the King (summon Ravenous Knight on each plate, continously summon proximity bombs on every player for roughly 10 seconds). Immune to damage aside from his crit spot and during final stand. Can be stunned by detonating Corrupted Light during Doxology channel.

: After Oryx casts his second Fist of Darkness per phase, he will cast Doxology. This is roughly 110 seconds after the first first per phase and seems to be shortened to 5 seconds after Brand of Immortality has been stolen.

: Oryx's final stand will spawn 2 successive Light-Eater Ogres nearest him while starting his Doxology channel. This final stand is triggered after four damage phases or when his final stand health gate is hit, whichever comes first. When his final stand starts, damage phase is interrupted.

**Light-Eater Ogre**

: Drops a Corrupted Light puddle at location of death. One spawns in each quadrant near each plate, in random sequence, roughly two seconds after each other. First one spawns roughly 5 seconds after the first Fist of Darkness. Presumably immune to finishers, as the Corrupted Light would resolve and wipe the raid.

**Light-Eater Knight**

: Consumes Corrupted Light after approaching it. Spawns after a Light-Eater Ogre outside of final stand is slain. Assuming the map is divided by the walls near the two plate sets, a LEK always spawns from the opposite plate on the same side when an Ogre dies outside of Oryx's final stand. Immune to finishers?

**Vessel of Oryx**

: Consumes Corrupted Light after approaching it. Spawns with the Brand of Immortality buff. Spawns from the Tombship roughly 90 seconds after the first Fist of Darkness.

**Shade of Oryx**

: Keeps the dome active while he is alive. Has no health bar and is immune to finishers.

## Challenge: Hands Off

No player can kill a Light-Eater Ogre or Light-Eater Knight **from the same spawn location** twice. To be explicit, the two Ogres spawns furthest from spawn will activate a maximum of five times and everything else pops a maximum of four times.
