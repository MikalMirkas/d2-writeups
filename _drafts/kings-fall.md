King's Fall is back. Long live the king.

# Prereading

- This isn't a guide, this is a mechanic explanation. There's many ways to handle these mechanics - do whatever's best for your raid team.
- Light for final encounter is {{power}}.

## Ammo Generation
This section is for you, Aeon users.
- Presumably no to few champions on Legend. Hive and Taken are in this raid, so any of the three champions types could be present.
- Presumably many champions on Master.

# Hall of Souls {#outside}

## Objective
Activate all six statues.

## Mechanics
**Statues**
: Six statues are in the center of the map - activating each of them will spawn a portal and end the encounter. Only statues marked by "dark energy" (Taken particles) can be activated. The text log "A statue hums with dark energy" appears when the eligible statue to dunk at has changed. To activate a statue, it must be deposited at twice in quick succession. Successful rapid dunks will open up the next statue. Taking too long will cause the last completed statue to revert.

### Interactables
**Relics**
: Relics are used to deposit at statues and spawn in sets of two. Relic holders can melee. When a relic is picked up from its starting position, a barrier spawns. The first set of relics are near the statues in the middle of the map and get progressively further away from the center, scaling with how many statues are activated. If they are on the ground for too long, they respawn at their initial pickup location. When they are dunked at a statue, they will spawn again after the statue either completes or rejects an isolated dunk.

**Barriers**
: The barriers that are triggered by relics spawn in doorways depending on which position that the relic has been acquired. They are immune to damage from relics and are vulnerable to gunfire. Barriers are impassible to players.

# Basilica {#totems}

Encounter starts by picking up the Brand of the Weaver.

## Objective
The objective of the encounter is to make totems go back to bed

### TL;DR
- Juggle Brand
- Deposit Power stacks
- Open the door

## Mechanics
**Annihilator Totems**
: Same thing as in *Pit of Heresy*. If any of the two totems fully charge, the raid wipes. Can be prevented by standing on the plates beneath them. The rooms that they are in are engulfed in fog.

**Fog**
: Presumably kills all players that it touches.

### Statuses
**Brand of the Weaver**
: Lasts 30 seconds. Found on the pedestals near the entrance of the totem rooms. Creates a safe zone around the player that negates the fog, granting the Aura of the Weaver buff while inside (excluding the Brand holder). Once the buff resolves, it is granted to a random player inside the aura if applicable and grants the wielder Deathsinger's Power x10. Also has the effect of Aura of the Weaver.

**Aura of the Weaver**
: Allows players to pass through the fog without penalty.

**Deathsinger's Power**
: Allows players to deposit the stacks onto the door plate to progress towards the door opening. Supposedly makes the afflicted players vulnerable to fog through the Weaver aura.

### Interactables
**Weaver Pedestal**
: Holds the Brand of the Weaver buff entity. Only active if their respective Brand is lost.

**Annihilator Plates**
: Prevents the Annihilator Totem above the plate from charging and slowly reverts their charge.

**Door Plate**
: Opens the door when enough stacks of Deathsinger's Power have been deposited.

# idk {#warpriest}

Encounter starts by activating all three plates.

## Objective
The objective of the encounter is to kill the Warpriest.

### TL;DR
- Kill Hallowed Knights
- Play Simon Says
- Get buff
- Allies do big boy damage, buff holder kill add to refresh timer at 0:02
- Hide from wipe mechanic
- Repeat until boss gives up

## Mechanics

**Monoliths**
: The big rock in front of each plate. During the glyph sequence, each monolith will glow from the front. The order that they glow in denotes the sequence that the plates must be activated in. During the Oculus mechanic, one monolith will be purged from the arena with the text prompt, "The Warpriest draws power from a monolith".

### Statuses
**Brand of the Initiate**
: Lasts 10 seconds. Has 5 stacks. Obtained by being the player to resolve the final plate. Grants the Aura of the Initiate buff to all nearby allies. Once the buff resolves from time, the player who had it dies. Killing an enemy resets the timer and removes a stack or removes the buff if all stacks are gone. When the buff expires, damage phase ends with the text prompt, "The Warpriest calls upon the Oculus". Also has the effect of Aura of the Initiate.

**Aura of the Initiate**
: Allows players to damage the Warpriest.

### Interactables
**Plates**
: Used in the glyph sequence. Player who activates the final plate gains the Brand of the Initiate buff.

### Mechanically Relevant Enemies
**Warpriest**
: Large Knight boss. Immune to damage.

**Hallowed Knight**
: Major Knight that spawns when trash mobs are dead. Spawns in sets of three, one per plate. Killing them starts the glyph sequence.

# Golgoroth's Cellar {#golgoroth}

Encounter is started by breaking the dark bubble.

## Objective
Kill Golgoroth.

### TL;DR
- Juggle Gaze, point towards team
- Team shoots ball, blast him in the tummy
- lol

## Mechanics
**Tablet of Ruin**
: Whenever a player dies, a rune is added to the large black column in the back of the room. If six runes are present, Exodia is summoned and instantly knocks your raid's life points to zero.

### Statuses

**Golgoroth's Gaze**
: Caretaker will inflict a debuff of the same name on someone who shoots him in the back with the text prompt, "Golgoroth shifts his Gaze". While gazed upon, Golgoroth will only cast Axion Darts at the debuffed player instead of using the normal Ogre attack kit. Lasts 20 seconds, only one gaze can be active at a time. Breaking line of sight instantly removes the debuff. Gaining Gaze while it is active will purge it on any other players. If gained during damage phase, a wave of Cursed Thrall spawn in the pit with the boss.

**Pool of Reclaimed Light**
: Once all the adds are dead, six orbs of light (not to be confused with orbs of power) will spawn on the ceiling. Shooting down an orb will enable the boss to be damaged from those inside the pool that it drops. Once all six orbs are gone, damage phase ends (and some stuff happens idk what).

**Unstable Light**
: Lasts 7 seconds after an orb hits the ground. Two players do their best Cursed Thrall impression, dealing damage to all nearby allies when the debuff expires.

### Mechanically Relevant Enemies
**Golgoroth**
: Immune to damage everywhere but his exposed back. Shooting him in the back will grant Golgoroth's Gaze. Weak spot is his glowing chest.
